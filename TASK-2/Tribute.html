            <h2>A brief summary of Jawaharlal Nehru</h2>
            <h3 class="neonText">Birth and Family Background</h3>
            <p>
                Jawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad in British India.His father,Motilal Nehru (1861-1931),a self-made wealthy barrister who belonged to the Kashmiri Pandit community,served twice as president of the Indian National Congress in 1919
                and 1928.His mother,Swarup Rani Thussu (1868-1938), who came from a well-known Kashmiri Brahmin family settled in Lahore,was Motilal's second wife,his first having died in child birth.Jawaharlal was the eldest of three children. His elder
                sister,Vijaya Lakshmi,later became the first female president of the United Nations General Assembly.His youngest sister,Krishna Hutheesing,became a noted writer and authored several books on her brother.

            <h3 class="neonText">Graduation</h3>
            <p>
                Nehru went to Trinity College,Cambridge,in October 1907 and graduated with an honours degree in natural science in 1910.During this period,he studied politics,economics,history and literature with interest.The writings of Bernard Shaw,H.G. Wells,John
                Maynard Keynes,Bertrand Russell,Lowes Dickinson and Meredith Townsend moulded much of his political and economic thinking.After completing his degree in 1910,Nehru moved to London and studied law at the Inner temple Inn.During this time,he
                continued to study Fabian Society scholars including Beatrice Webb.He was called to the Bar in 1912.

            <h3 class="neonText">Salt Satyagraha Scuccess</h3>
            <p>
                The salt satyagraha ("pressure for reform through passive resistance")succeeded in attracting world attention.Indian,British,and world opinion increasingly recognised the legitimacy of the claims by the Congress party for independence.Nehru considered
                the salt satyagraha the high-water mark of his association with Gandhi,and felt its lasting importance was in changing the attitudes of Indians:Of course these movements exercised tremendous pressure on the British Government and shook
                the government machinery.But the real importance,to my mind,lay in the effect they had on our own people,and especially the village masses.Non-cooperation dragged them out of the mire and gave them self-respect and self-reliance .They
                acted courageously and did not submit so easily to unjust oppression;their outlook widened and they began to think a little in terms of India as a whole.It was a remarkable transformation and the Congress,under Gandhi'sleadership ,must
                have the credit for it.

            <h3 class="neonText">Writings</h3>
            <p>
                Nehru was a prolific writer in English who wrote The Discovery of India, Glimpses of World History, An Autobiography(released in the United States as "Toward Freedom,") and Letters from a Father to His Daughter, all written in jail.Letters comprised 30
                letters written to his daughter Indira Priyadarshani Nehru (later Gandhi) who was then 10 years old and studying at a boarding school in Mussoorie.It attempted to instruct her about natural history and world civilisation.Nehru's books
                have been widely read.An Autobiography,in particular,has been critically acclaimed.John Gunther,writing in Inside Asia,contrasted it with Gandhi's autobiography:The Mahatma's placid story compares to Nehru's as a cornflower to an orchid,a
                rhyming couplet to a sonnet by MacLeish or Auden,a water pistol to a machine gun.Nehru's autobiography is subtle,complex,discriminating,infinitely cultivated,steeped in doubt,suffused with intellectual passion . Lord Halifax once said
                that no one could understand India without reading it.It is a kind of 'Education of Henry Adams,'written in superlative prose—hardly a dozen men alive write English as well as Nehru.

            <h3 class="neonText">Death</h3>
            <p>
                Nehru's health began declining steadily in 1962.In the spring of 1962,he was affected with viral infection over which he spent most of April in bed.In the next year,through 1963,he spent months recuperating in Kashmir.Some writers attribute this dramatic
                decline to his surprise and chagrin over the Sino-Indian War,which he perceived as a betrayal of trust.Upon his return from Dehradun on 26 May 1964,he was feeling quite comfortable and went to bed at about 23:30 as usual.He had a restful
                night until about 06:30.Later,Nehru complained of pain in the back.He spoke to the doctors who attended on him for a brief while,and almost immediately he collapsed.He remained unconscious until he died at 13:44.His death was announced
                in the Lok Sabha at 14:00 local time on 27 May 1964;the cause of death was believed to be a heart attack.Draped in the Indian national Tri-colour flag,the body of Jawaharlal Nehru was placed for public viewing."Raghupati Raghava Rajaram"
                was chanted as the body was placed on the platform.On 28 May,Nehru was cremated in accordance with Hindu rites at the Shantivan on the banks of the Yamuna,witnessed by 1.5 million mourners who had flocked into the streets of Delhi and
                the cremation grounds.Nehru's death left India with no clear political heir to his leadership.Lal Bahadur Shastri later succeeded Nehru as the prime minister.The death was announced to the Indian parliament in words similar to Nehru's
                own at the time of Gandhi's assassination:"The light is out."India's future prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee famously delivered Nehru an acclaimed eulogy.He hailed Nehru as Bharat Mata's" favourite prince" and likened him to the Hindu
                god Rama.
